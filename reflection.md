What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

With borders and margins, I learned that it takes a lot of trial and error, especially when it comes to pixel sizes, to really nail the goal you're looking for. I didn't use a lot of borders in the end, but when I was initially placing elements, I would use them temporarily to get a better idea of how they were moving within the page.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I didn't use many types of positioning, only because I don't have a lot of block or section style elements that would need to play off of each other visually. I did try a few different ones just to make sure I have my head wrapped around the concepts well enough. This is something I need to work on, and as I continue to improve the page, I want to explore positioning more.


What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Aligning and spacing everything wasn't too difficult. That seemed like it just took a lot of back and forth and trying different sizes. The hardest thing still seems to be positioning sections relative to others, and deciding when to use the various positions.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that I need to think more about elements inside of elements. I made some initial CSS changes to elements that I thought would apply to the elements inside them, but I realized I needed to get even more specific which which elements I was trying to zero in on.
