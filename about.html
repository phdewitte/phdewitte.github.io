    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Patrick DeWitte, and I am diving head first into the world of web development, through the immersive Dev Bootcamp experience. It is my goal to learn how to create technology that aids in the rights management and payment of artists, songwriters, publishers, and record labels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last ten years of my life I've been professionally involved in bringing live or recorded music to fans all over the country. Here are just a few highlights from my music career so far...
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in 2006 as an audio engineer for the PBS concert series <span>Soundstage</span>, I was able to work with household names like Stevie Nicks, Bon Jovi and Josh Groban, as well as then booming independent acts like Dashboard Confessional, Death Cab For Cutie, and Fall Out Boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2010, I was a tour manager for an independent Chicago band called A Lull, beginning with a two week long tour supporting Cold War Kids throughout the US and Canada. Along with a brief stint with the group Empires, tour managing took me through most of the US, and parts of Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mid 2011, I began engineering for a live-performance series called Audiotree Live. As the company was very new, there was much to be done in the realms of licensing, distribution, and general rights managemnet. All of this, I took upon myself to learn and implement within the company. Over 600 bands later, Audiotree is a formidable promotional tool for independent artists, as well as an additional monetary tool thanks to Audiotree's distribution via Spotify, iTunes, and other major music retailers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my goal, upon completion of my Dev Bootcamp education, to find a way to unify music rights holders, be they songwriters, publishers, or record labels, and the music technologies that use their copyrights. Much ink has been spilled over who owns how much of a song, who owes which party how much, and why so few think they're earning enough. I want to be the guy that connects the dots for everyone involved, so that everyone can thrive.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a lifelong Illinois resident, and I currently reside in Chicago, IL (though I'm open to relocating). When I'm not learning how to develop web technology, I am slow-smoking BBQ, baking traditional French breads, or working my way through the Criterion Collection.
