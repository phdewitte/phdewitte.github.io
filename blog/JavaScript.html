      <h2>JavaScript Obejcts vs Ruby Hashes</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        After diving into the world of JavaScript here at Dev Bootcamp, I got a good luck at
        objects, and their similarities to Ruby hashes. Both can be considered key/value pairs, meaning that for a given "key", or starting input, there will be an associated "value" tied to it. Here's what that looks like in Ruby...

      <p>
        Nothing really crazy going on here.You can set a key value within the hash either as a symbol, or as a string. Keys and symbols can be any other type of Ruby object, but we're just using strings, symbols and integers here. As mentioned above, we have a key (like "name") with a value (like "Patrick").  Let's see what that looks like in Javascript...
      </p>

      <p>
        Very similar, right? Mostly. Unlike a Ruby hash, a JavaScript object can store a function. That is, a property within a JavaScript object may contain an expression that affects that objects or other objects, depending on the scope. In a Ruby hash, your goal is simply storage of data. You wouldn't be using a key or value within a Ruby Hash to execute more code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruby and JavaScript are very similar in more ways than this, but it is important to keep in mind their simple differences. As these concepts become more clear, I hope to provide future examples of how this will be important to your development project.
