      <h2>Building phdewitte.github.io</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Looking over this site that I've built from scratch, and looking at other great examples of web design, it's crazy to think about just how much you can throw at any particular design project. In some ways, I feel like I haven't done enough here. The resources and options are limitless, and what I hope to continue discovering throughout the process of my development journey is just which design tools can help me best achieve my goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first version of this site was styled (poorly) in a manner that didn't really offer a lot of room for change. It had a look, and the look was... a look. Know what I mean? Being able to revisit the construction of it and make necessary changes to improve the operation and overall aesthetics, while still keeping plenty of room for future development was very beneficial to me. And now that simple aesthetic features that I've decided to take on are no longer in my way, I can really concentrate on implementing useful technology that will further improve the function and aesthetics of my site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being a fan of minimal design, I'm able to accept that this site may be a bit lacking. But I see the benefit of that being the fact that at any point from where the site is at now, additions to functionality or aesthetic changes will be less of a construction project. I remember struggling early on while building the site over just making it look atractive (and it didn't). I'm going to find new fonts I like. I'm going to discover new color schemes. I'm going to find add ons and all sorts of other additions to the site. I'm glad that I've gotten it to a point where those additions will not require a complete reconstruction, but additions as they are appropriate.
