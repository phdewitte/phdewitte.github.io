<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Being paired with someone who was more familiar with this week's lesson than I was very helpful. I've had a few late nights at work, and he was very helpful. I would imagine though that it might be fairly hard to pair with someone on some design based projects, unless the two people are very like minded.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes, but I think I'll need to see more examples. As someone who isn't very visually artistic, it's hard looking at a blank screen and having to come up with an outline, even if it's a rudimentary one. It's strange that, even though I look at webpages all day, I don't exactly know where to start in deciding how to structure one.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We decided that it should focus on text, but be broken up with images so as not to seem like one big pile. The blogs I enjoy reading are well spaced out and info-heavy, but not overwhelmingly text heavy. Creating some space and some air make a blog more readable in my mind, though that was a little hard to convey in a wireframe.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)

I was unfamiliar with the <hr> tag. I like separating different parts of text within a document, so I think this will come in handy.
